# Ruby on Rails -- Stephanie Ratanas

## About
Ruby on Rails is a framework written in the Ruby language. It is meant to make things easy by making assumptions about what you need to create an application. This replaces node.js in our curent stack.

## Set Up
Install Ruby and Rails:

`brew install ruby`

then 

`gem install rails`


## Spin up a new project with a database

`rails new myapp -d postgresql`

Now you have a ready to go app with a server connected to a database! Wow!

To start server on the command line:
`rails server`

## Next steps
I started building out a CRUD app here: https://github.com/sratanas/ruby-one
