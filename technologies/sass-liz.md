# SASS! by Liz Elton

## About
Sass is a CSS preprocessor. It makes writing CSS for larger projects more manageable and allows smaller projects to be up and running more quickly. It also allows you to use nested rules, variables, built-in functions, and MATH (!) to create fully compatible CSS files.

## Set Up

To get started with Sass, you must first install it. There are many different ways that can be found [here](http://sass-lang.com/install), but I went with [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) for my demo. I installed node-sass globally with

`npm install -g node-sass`

node-sass runs from the command line, so in order to create a CSS file from your SCSS file, you must run

`node-sass-o css css/yourfilename.scss`

## Hello World

Here is my [Hello World!](https://github.com/decameters/sassy-sass-sassface) example, built with HTML and SCSS. This shows you how nesting and variables work within SCSS files.

## Next steps

The next steps for learning would be to find a more in-depth video demo, especially one that has more examples for functions and math within Sass.

## Another cool thing

Here's a [Sass playground](https://www.sassmeister.com/) to get the feel for sassy things!
