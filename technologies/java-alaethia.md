# Java - Alaethia 

## About
Java is a general-purpose programming language that is object-oriented and designed to have as few dependencies as possible so that it can run on any platform that support java. 

## Set Up
- To set up java on your local machine download the java JDK off of oracles website. 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html
- run `java -version` in terminal to make sure it has been installed. 
 Should get a response of : java version "10" 2018-03-20 or a newer version if it has been updated. 
- Choose an IDE to write and run your code. 
- For this assignment I stuck with VS code becasue I am familiar with it. 
- Once you have written your code run `javac "name of file in IDE"` (this should just return your terminal with the file you are in ex. Alaethias-MBP:Java alaethia$)( What I ran: `javac HelloWorld.java` ) 
- Then run `java "just file name with no .java` (it will run your class)( What I ran: `java HelloWorld` )

## Next steps
The next steps I want to take in learning java are: 

- Learn more about object-oriented programming in general to get a better understanding of what java is capable of 

- Spend some time on Treehouse to learn more concepts about java 

- Explore other IDE's when creating new applications or projects

- Explore and implement other frameworks of Java (ie. Spring)

- set up a small app (ex. user interactive with inputs of who they are: name, occupation, hobbies)
