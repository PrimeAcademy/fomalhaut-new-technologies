# Hello World using Java

## About
Java is a class based, object oriented programming language. Java is meant to be "Write once, run anywhere" which means it is supposed to be able to run on all platforms without the need for recompiling.

## Set Up
To get started with Java you must install [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
To make it easy to create a servlet I'd suggest downloading an IED, I used [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac).
