# Hello World using Java

## About
React and Axios work together to retrieve data from the server.

## Set Up
To get started with React and Axios, you mus install them with 

`npm install react`

and 

`npm install axios`

I go into a lot more depth in [this lecture repo](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/betelgeuse-introduction-to-react), although, there is admitedly a lot of content in there.

## Next steps

The next steps for learning this is to understand the role of middleware like flux/redux and logging/sagas. These are tools used to manage state, but since this [Hello List](https://github.com/LukeSchlangen/simplified-react-axios) example only has a single state (displaying the list), the next step will likely be adding something to the list with a `POST`.
