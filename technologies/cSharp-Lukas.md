# C# Learn a Language Plan

## About
Setting up an IDE to write and compile C# programs on Mac.

## Set Up
To get started you will need to download and install Visual Studio for Mac. 

https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/mac/
It will prompt you to install the latest version of X-Code if you do not have it installed already.

Open up Visual Studio and select "New Solution", go to .NET and select Console Application

## Hello World

 Hello World is a console application which means that the interface will only be in the console.  No GUI.

When creating a new console application, visual studio actually starts you off with a method that contains the  Console.Write("Hello World"); 


## Next steps

Next steps are to write a program that takes in user input and stores it.  My example will be a fitness tracking app that prompts the user to input their time spent exercising and will store that value and continue to prompt until the app is closed. 

From there, I would look to use other data structures like Arrays and objects to store values.  Eventually, connect a database and save information.  Once I've learned Console based applications, I would look to implement HTTP requests using the .NET framework.
