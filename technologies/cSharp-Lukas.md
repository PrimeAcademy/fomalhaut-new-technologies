# C# Learn a Language Plan

## About
Setting up an IDE to write and compile C# programs on Mac.

## Set Up
To get started you will need to download and install Visual Studio for Mac. 

https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/mac/
It will prompt you to install the latest version of X-Code if you do not have it installed already.


## Hello World

Here is a link to my [Hello List](https://github.com/LukeSchlangen/simplified-react-axios) example built with React and Axios. This returns an array from a `mockable` http endpoint and displays it on the DOM.

## Next steps

The next steps for learning this is to understand the role of middleware like flux/redux and logging/sagas. These are tools used to manage state, but since this [Hello List](https://github.com/LukeSchlangen/simplified-react-axios) example only has a single state (displaying the list), the next step will likely be adding something to the list with a `POST`.
