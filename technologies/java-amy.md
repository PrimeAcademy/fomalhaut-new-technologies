# Java by Amy

## About
Java is a general-purpose, strongly-typed progamming language. It uses object-oriented programming principles and was created by Oracle.

## Setup
- Download the JDK (Java Development Kit) from Oracle's website (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- Verify JDK installation in terminal. Enter 'jshell'; Response: 'Welcome to JShell -- Version 10.'
- Choose an IDE to start writing & running Java. I chose IntelliJ IDEA, created by JetBrains. (Download here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac).
