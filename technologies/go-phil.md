## About
![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*fyyS1OHEaQ2il8Tg.png)

[Go](https://golang.org/) is a fast, statically typed, compiled language that
feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

## Set Up
To get started with Go, visit [GoLang.org](https://golang.org/) and check out the
'Download Go' section.

After downloading and installing Go, create a .go file in any IDE, VSCode or
Atom. i.e. HelloWorld.go

To run your Go code, use the `go build` command in the terminal of the directory
of your .go file. This command will build an executable file named after the
directory that the `go build` command was run in.

To run your Go executable, in the directory of the executable, you can run
./filename in the terminal. You can also navigate to the folder of the file and
run the code by double clicking the executable.

## Hello Go

Here is a link to my [Hello Go](https://github.com/Philip-Owen/Hello-Go) code.

## Next steps

The next steps for learning Go would be to keep going through the Go tutorials
and continuing to read the Documentation. Eventually I would like to remove
Node.JS from the back-end of one of my applications and replace it with Go.
