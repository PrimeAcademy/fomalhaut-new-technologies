# Hello World - Java using Eclipse

## About
Java is a is a popular general-purpose object oriented programming language and computing platform. It is fast, reliable, and secure.

## Set Up
- For an IDE to assist with writing and running Java I used Eclipse. https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/oomph/epp/oxygen/R2/eclipse-inst-mac64.tar.gz
Once installed it should have a walkthrough on how to get started with Java and the process of how to make the Hello World show up.
- If Eclipse did not have a JDK upon setup download a JDK to be used with Eclipse. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
